# Interactive Personal Data Collector

Welcome to the Interactive Personal Data Collector, a Python-based application designed to capture, process, and display personal information using fundamental programming concepts!

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the use of basic Python functions like `print()` and `input()`, along with data types, variables, operators, type casting, and built-in functions such as `id()` and `type()`. Itâ€™s a great way to explore Python fundamentals while creating something useful!

## Features
- Collects user information: name, age, height, and favorite number.
- Processes data to calculate the approximate birth year.
- Displays detailed output including data types and memory addresses.
- Uses type casting to ensure accurate data handling.

## How It Works
1. The program welcomes the user and prompts for personal details.
2. It processes the input data, performing calculations like birth year estimation.
3. A summary is displayed, showing values, data types, and memory locations.
4. Ends with a friendly goodbye message.

## Installation
1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository: `git clone <your-repo-link>`
3. Navigate to the project folder and run the script: `python personal_data_collector.py`

## Usage
Simply run the script and follow the on-screen prompts to enter your details. The program will handle the rest and show you a neat summary!

## Assumptions
- The current year is assumed to be 2025 for birth year calculation.
- Height is collected in meters and stored as a float.
- Age and favorite number are treated as integers.

## Example Console Output
```
Welcome to the Interactive Personal Data Collector!
Please enter your name: Alice
Please enter your age: 25
Please enter your height in meters: 1.68
Please enter your favourite number: 7

Thank you! Here is the information we collected:
Name: Alice (Type: <class 'str'>, Memory Address: 140703847239568)
Age: 25 (Type: <class 'int'>, Memory Address: 9793456)
Height: 1.68 (Type: <class 'float'>, Memory Address: 140703847253232)
Favourite Number: 7 (Type: <class 'int'>, Memory Address: 9793312)

Your birth year is approximately: 1998 (based on your age of 25)

Thank you for using the Personal Data Collector. Goodbye!
